# Malaysia Issue to Investigate : "Is there a significant gender disparity in skills-related underemployment trends across different time periods?" <br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Overview <br>
DISCLAIMER: I was enrolled in an elective subject called "Machine Learning," where we were introduced into the basics of machine learning, and focused on learning machine models. From our group's assignment, we were required to investigate a certain issue in Malaysia that is prevalent among the people. Through investigation, we had to implement certain machine learning models (deemed suitable for the dataset) that we had learned in class. 

In Malaysia, the country faces a significant gender gap in underemployment, particularly concerning the utilization of skills. Studies show women are more likely than men to face both time-related and skill-related underemployment conditions. This research underscores the gender disparities in skills-related underemployment as a notable issue in Malaysia. Therefore, this project investigates the following key question:

"Is there a significant gender disparity in skills-related underemployment trends across different time periods?"

Our group's research explores the development of gender gap in skills-related underemployment through an analysis of established patterns and trends. This investigation seeks to provide insights that could inform policy interventions and contribute to addressing this persistent challenge using Linear Regression Model, and PCA.
